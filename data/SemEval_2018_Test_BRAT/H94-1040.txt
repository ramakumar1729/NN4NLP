A simple and general method is described that can combine different knowledge sources to reorder N-best lists of hypotheses produced by a speech recognizer. The method is automatically trainable, acquiring information from both positive and negative examples. In experiments, the method was tested on a 1000-utterance sample of unseen ATIS data.
