Computer users increasingly need to produce text written in multiple languages. However, typical computer interfaces require the user to change the text entry software each time a different language is used. This is cumbersome, especially when language changes are frequent. To solve this problem, we propose TypeAny, a novel front-end interface that detects the language of the user's key entry and automatically dispatches the input to the appropriate text entry system. Unlike previously reported methods, TypeAny can handle more than two languages, and can easily support any new language even if the available corpus is small. When evaluating this method, we obtained language detection accuracy of 96.7% when an appropriate language had to be chosen from among three languages. The number of control actions needed to switch languages was decreased over 93% when using TypeAny rather than a conventional method.
