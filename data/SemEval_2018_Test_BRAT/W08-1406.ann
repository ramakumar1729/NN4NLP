T1	NoType 36 53	 usually take as 
T2	NoType 58 63	 the 
T3	NoType 69 76	 of an 
T4	NoType 117 150	 that is affected by issues like 
T5	NoType 175 177	, 
T6	NoType 189 241	, or difficulties in the accurate identification of 
T7	NoType 260 305	. We propose the inclusion of related, solid 
T8	NoType 327 373	 to cope with the difficulties of summarizing 
T9	NoType 388 404	 and the use of 
T10	NoType 443 447	 in 
T11	NoType 491 547	. In this work, we explore the possibilities offered by 
T12	NoType 567 582	 to select the 
T13	NoType 604 619	 and conduct a 
T14	NoType 640 697	 to better assess the relevance of the inclusion of that 
T15	NoType 708 728	. Results show that 
T16	NoType 737 829	 generated using this approach are considerably better than those produced by an up-to-date 
T17	NoType 880 912	 and suggest that humans prefer 
T18	NoType 921 940	 restricted to the 
T19	NoType 951 968	 conveyed in the 
T20	NoType 980 982	.
