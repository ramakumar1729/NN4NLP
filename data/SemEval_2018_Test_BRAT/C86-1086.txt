A new Theory of Names and Descriptions that offers a uniform treatment for many types of non-singular concepts found in natural language discourse is presented. We introduce a layered model of the language denotational base (the universe) in which every world object is assigned a layer (level) reflecting its relative singularity with respect to other objects in the universe. We define the notion of relative singularity of world objects as an abstraction class of the layer-membership relation.
