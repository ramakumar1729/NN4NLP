T1	NoType 20 24	 of 
T2	NoType 39 74	 have application in many areas of 
T3	NoType 101 111	, such as 
T4	NoType 128 133	 and 
T5	NoType 154 216	. We report a comparative study of two methods for estimating 
T6	NoType 245 258	 required by 
T7	NoType 282 288	. Our 
T8	NoType 307 344	 are generated from a terabyte-sized 
T9	NoType 350 354	 of 
T10	NoType 362 391	, and we study the impact of 
T11	NoType 402 431	 on the effectiveness of the 
T12	NoType 439 471	. We base the evaluation on one 
T13	NoType 489 498	 and two 
T14	NoType 521 554	, each consisting of a number of 
T15	NoType 579 597	 seeking the best 
T16	NoType 604 617	 for a given 
T17	NoType 628 655	. For two question sets, a 
T18	NoType 662 671	 for the 
T19	NoType 682 723	 is provided, and we examine a number of 
T20	NoType 747 766	 that exploit this 
T21	NoType 773 799	. Our best combination of 
T22	NoType 817 822	 and 
T23	NoType 849 948	 answers 6-8% more questions than the best results previously reported for the same question sets.
