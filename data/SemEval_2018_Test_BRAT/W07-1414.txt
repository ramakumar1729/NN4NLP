This paper addresses syntax-based paraphrasing methods for Recognizing Textual Entailment (RTE). In particular, we describe a dependency-based paraphrasing algorithm, using the DIRT data set, and its application in the context of a straightforward RTE system based on aligning dependency trees. We find a small positive effect of dependency-based paraphrasing on both the RTE3 development and test sets, but the added value of this type of paraphrasing deserves further analysis.
