It is argued in this paper that an optimal solution to disambiguation is a combination of linguistically motivated rules and resolution based on probability or heuristic rules. By disambiguation is here meant ambiguity resolution on all levels of language analysis, including morphology and semantics. The discussion is based on Swahili, for which a comprehensive analysis system has been developed by using two-level description in morphology and constraint grammar formalism in disambiguation. Particular attention is paid to optimising the use of different solutions for achieving maximal precision with minimal rule writing.
