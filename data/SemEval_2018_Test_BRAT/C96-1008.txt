We are going to describe the design and implementation of a communication system for large AI projects, capable of supporting various software components in a heterogeneous hardware and programming-language environment. The system is based on a modification of the channel approach introduced by Hoare (1978). It is a three-layered approach with a de facto standard network layer (PVM.), core routines, and interfaces to five different programming languages together with support for the transparent exchange of complex data types. A special component takes over name service functions. It also records the actual configuration of the >modules present in the application and the created channels. We describe the integration of this communication facility in two versions of a speech-to-speech translation system, which dilfer with regard to quality and quantity of data distributed within the applications and with regard to the degree of interactivity involved in processing.
