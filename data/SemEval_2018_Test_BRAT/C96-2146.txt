This paper describes a method for analyzing Japanese double-subject construction having an adjective predicate based on the valency structure. A simple sentence usually has only one subjective case in most languages. However, many Japanese adjectives (and some verbs) can dominate two surface subjective cases within a simple sentence. Such sentence structure is called the double-subject construction. This paper classifies the Japanese double-subject construction into four types and describes problems arising when analyzing these types using ordinary Japanese construction approaches. This paper proposes a method for analyzing a Japanese double-subject construction having an adjective predicate in order to overcome thee problems described. By applying this method to Japanese sentence analysis in Japanese-to-English machine translation systems, translation accuracy can be improved because this method can analyze correctly the double-subject construction.
