A parser is an algorithm that assigns a structural description to a string according to a grammar. It follows from this definition that there are three general issues in parser design: the structure to be assigned, the type of grammar, the recognition algorithm. Common parsers employ phrase structure descriptions, rule-based grammars, and derivation or transition oriented recognition. The following choices result in a new parser: The structure to be assigned to the input is a dependency tree with lexical, morpho-syntactic and functional-syntactic information associated with each node and coded by complex categories which are subject to unification. The grammar is lexicalized, i.e. the syntactical relationships are stated as part of the lexical descriptions of the elements of the language. The algorithm relies on the slot and filler principle in order to draw up complex structures. It utilizes a well-formed substring table (chart) which allows for discontinuous segments.
