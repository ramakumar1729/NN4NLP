A deductive approach is used to predict vowel and consonant places of articulation. Based on two main criteria, viz. simple and efficient use of an acoustic tube, along with maximum acoustic dispersion, the Distinctive Regions Model (DRM) of speech production derives regions that closely correspond to established  vowel and consonant places of articulation.
