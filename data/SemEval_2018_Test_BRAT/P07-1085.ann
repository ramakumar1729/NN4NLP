T1	NoType 30 53	 is important for both 
T2	NoType 83 129	. It is often achieved by combining a generic 
T3	NoType 131 139	 with a 
T4	NoType 159 189	 that is more relevant to the 
T5	NoType 204 230	. Unlike previous work on 
T6	NoType 256 304	, this paper investigates how effectively using 
T7	NoType 333 366	, instead of considering all the 
T8	NoType 371 379	, helps 
T9	NoType 392 410	. We evaluate two 
T10	NoType 442 466	 in this paper, namely, 
T11	NoType 476 481	 and 
T12	NoType 514 555	. In addition, a new dynamically adapted 
T13	NoType 571 576	 for 
T14	NoType 596 618	 is proposed based on 
T15	NoType 636 677	. Our experimental results show that the 
T16	NoType 700 744	 framework outperforms the baseline generic 
T17	NoType 746 786	. The best result is obtained using the 
T18	NoType 804 822	 by expanding the 
T19	NoType 836 842	 with 
T20	NoType 870 910	, together with using a large number of 
T21	NoType 916 933	, which yields a 
T22	NoType 953 997	 of 14.23% compared to the baseline generic 
T23	NoType 999 1001	.
