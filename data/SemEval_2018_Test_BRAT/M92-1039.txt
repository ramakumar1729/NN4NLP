The University of Michigan's natural language processing system, called LINK, is a unification-based system which we have developed over the last four years. Prior to MUC-4, LINK had been used to extract information from free-form texts in two narrow application domains. One application corpus contained terse descriptions of symptoms displayed by malfunctioning automobiles, and the repairs which fixed them. The other corpus described sequences of activities to be performed on an assembly line. In empirical testing in these two domains, LINK correctly processed 70% of previously unseen descriptions. A template was counted as correct only if all of the fillers in the template were filled correctly. In addition, LINK generated incomplete (but not incorrect) templates for another 15% of the descriptions. These previous domains were much narrower than the MUC-4 terrorism domain. As a comparison, the lexicons for the previous domains contained only 300-500 words, compared with 6700 words in our MUC-4 test configuration. Previous grammar size ranged from 75-100 rules, compared with over 500 rules in the MUC-4 knowledge base. In addition, the previous application domains consisted only of single-sentence inputs. Thus, the integration of information from multiple sentences was not an issue in our previous work.
