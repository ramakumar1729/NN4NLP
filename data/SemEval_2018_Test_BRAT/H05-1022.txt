HMM-based models are developed for the alignment of words and phrases in bitext. The models are formulated so that alignment and parameter estimation can be performed efficiently. We find that Chinese-English word alignment performance is comparable to that of IBM Model-4 even over large training bitexts. Phrase pairs extracted from word alignments generated under the model can also be used for phrase-based translation, and in Chinese to English and Arabic to English translation, performance is comparable to systems based on Model-4 alignments. Direct phrase pair induction under the model is described and shown to improve translation performance.
