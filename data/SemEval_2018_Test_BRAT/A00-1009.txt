In this paper we describe an implemented framework for developing monolingual or multilingual natural language generation (NLG) applications and machine translation (MT) applications. The framework demonstrates a uniform approach to generation and transfer based on declarative lexico-structural transformations of dependency structures of syntactic or conceptual levels ("uniform lexico-structural processing "). We describe how this framework has been used in practical NLG and MT applications, and report the lessons learned.
