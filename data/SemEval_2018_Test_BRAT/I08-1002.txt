This paper reports our empirical evaluation and comparison of several popular goodness measures for unsupervised segmentation of Chinese texts using Bakeoff-3 data sets with a unified framework. Assuming no prior knowledge about Chinese, this framework relies on a goodness measure to identify word candidates from unlabeled texts and then applies a generalized decoding algorithm to find the optimal segmentation of a sentence into such candidates with the greatest sum of goodness scores. Experiments show that description length gain outperforms other measures because of its strength for identifying short words. Further performance improvement is also reported, achieved by proper candidate pruning and by assemble segmentation to integrate the strengths of individual measures.
