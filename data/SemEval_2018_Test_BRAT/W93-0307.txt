 Lexical co-occurrence statistics are becoming widely used in the syntactic analysis of unconstrained text. However, analyses based solely on lexical relationships suffer from sparseness of data: it is sometimes necessary to use a less informed model in order to reliably estimate statistical parameters. For example, the "lexical association" strategy for resolving ambiguous prepositional phrase attachments [Hindle and Rooth 1991] takes into account only the attachment site (a verb or its direct object ) and the preposition, ignoring the object of the preposition.We investigated an extension of the lexical association strategy to make use of noun class information, thus permitting a disambiguation strategy to take more information into account. Although in preliminary experiments the extended strategy did not yield improved performance over lexical association alone, a qualitative analysis of results suggests that the problem lies not in the noun class information, but rather in the multiplicity of classes available for each noun in the absence of sense disambiguation. This suggests several possible revisions of our proposal.
