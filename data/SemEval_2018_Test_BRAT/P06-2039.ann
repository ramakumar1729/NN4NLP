T1	NoType 21 128	 has already been proposed in literature. In particular, attempts are being made to develop techniques for 
T2	NoType 142 153	 where the 
T3	NoType 159 164	 and 
T4	NoType 180 201	 are different, e.g. 
T5	NoType 228 277	 (Hwa et al., 2005). This enables one to develop 
T6	NoType 290 295	 for 
T7	NoType 311 325	 having fewer 
T8	NoType 341 361	 with the help of a 
T9	NoType 390 396	. The 
T10	NoType 409 423	 works on the 
T11	NoType 458 508	 which simply means
that the relation between two 
T12	NoType 513 521	 of the 
T13	NoType 545 598	 can be projected directly between the corresponding 
T14	NoType 603 611	 of the 
T15	NoType 644 737	. However, we find that this assumption does not hold good all the time. This leads to wrong 
T16	NoType 754 761	of the 
T17	NoType 785 832	. As a solution we propose an algorithm called 
T18	NoType 849 872	 that can work even if 
T19	NoType 904 1003	 is not guaranteed. The proposed algorithm works in a recursive manner by considering the embedded 
T20	NoType 1020 1091	 from outermost level to the innermost. The present work discusses the 
T21	NoType 1105 1142	, and illustrates it with respect to 
T22	NoType 1169 1171	. 
T23	NoType 1197 1236	 has been considered as the underlying 
T24	NoType 1250 1266	 for this work.
