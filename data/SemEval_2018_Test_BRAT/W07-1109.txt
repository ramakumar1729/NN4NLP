This paper proposes an approach of processing Japanese compound functional expressions by identifying them and analyzing their dependency relations through a machine learning technique. First, we formalize the task of identifying Japanese compound functional expressions in a text as a machine learning based chunking problem. Next, against the results of identifying compound functional expressions, we apply the method of dependency analysis based on the cascaded chunking model. The results of experimental evaluation show that, the dependency analysis model achieves improvements when applied after identifying compound functional expressions, compared with the case where it is applied without identifying compound functional expressions.
