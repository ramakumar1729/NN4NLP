T1	NoType 15 43	 is very important for many 
T2	NoType 59 68	 such as 
T3	NoType 89 91	, 
T4	NoType 120 126	, and 
T5	NoType 148 171	. Most of the previous 
T6	NoType 201 208	 use a 
T7	NoType 230 236	 or a 
T8	NoType 264 302	. Therefore, they require much of the 
T9	NoType 322 331	 such as 
T10	NoType 362 369	 (e.g. 
T11	NoType 390 395	 and 
T12	NoType 414 443	). This paper proposes a new 
T13	NoType 465 480	 that uses the 
T14	NoType 517 546	. It finds the most probable 
T15	NoType 567 575	 of the 
T16	NoType 589 599	 by using 
T17	NoType 645 655	 from the 
T18	NoType 672 686	 and extracts 
T19	NoType 691 705	 by detecting 
T20	NoType 720 798	. Furthermore, it does not require any labor for constructing and maintaining 
T21	NoType 818 879	. We have performed various experiments with a wide range of 
T22	NoType 888 961	 influencing the performance. The experimental results show that without 
T23	NoType 983 987	 or 
T24	NoType 998 1004	, the 
T25	NoType 1019 1040	 achieves comparable 
T26	NoType 1051 1070	 with the previous 
T27	NoType 1077 1079	.
