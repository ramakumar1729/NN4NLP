T1	NoType 16 39	 are developed for the 
T2	NoType 48 52	 of 
T3	NoType 57 62	 and 
T4	NoType 69 73	 in 
T5	NoType 79 85	. The 
T6	NoType 91 115	 are formulated so that 
T7	NoType 124 129	 and 
T8	NoType 149 193	 can be performed efficiently. We find that 
T9	NoType 235 261	 is comparable to that of 
T10	NoType 272 289	 even over large 
T11	NoType 305 307	. 
T12	NoType 319 335	 extracted from 
T13	NoType 350 371	 generated under the 
T14	NoType 376 398	 can also be used for 
T15	NoType 422 431	, and in 
T16	NoType 483 485	, 
T17	NoType 496 514	 is comparable to 
T18	NoType 521 531	 based on 
T19	NoType 549 551	. 
T20	NoType 579 590	 under the 
T21	NoType 595 630	 is described and shown to improve 
T22	NoType 653 655	.
