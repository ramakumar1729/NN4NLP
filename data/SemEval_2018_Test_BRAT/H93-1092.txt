The primary objective of this project is to develop a robust, high-performance parser for English by automatically extracting a grammar from an annotated corpus of bracketed sentences, called the Treebank. The project is a collaboration between the IBM Continuous Speech Recognition Group and the University of Pennsylvania Department of Computer Sciences.
