The Document Understanding Conference (DUC) 2005 evaluation had a single user-oriented, question-focused summarization task, which was to synthesize from a set of 25-50 documents a well-organized, fluent answer to a complex question. The evaluation shows that the best summarization systems have difficulty extracting relevant sentences in response to complex questions (as opposed to representative sentences that might be appropriate to a generic summary ). The relatively generous allowance of 250 words for each answer also reveals how difficult it is for current summarization systems to produce fluent text from multiple documents.
