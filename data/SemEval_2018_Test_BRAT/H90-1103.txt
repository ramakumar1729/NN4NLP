This paper presents a study of military applications of advanced speech processing technology which includes three major elements: (1) review and assessment of current efforts in military applications of speech technology ; (2) identification of opportunities for future military applications of advanced speech technology ; and (3) identification of problem areas where research in speech processing is needed to meet application requirements, and of current research thrusts which appear promising. The relationship of this study to previous assessments of military applications of speech technology is discussed, and substantial recent progress is noted. Current efforts in military applications of speech technology which are highlighted include : (1) narrowband (2400 b/s) and very low-rate (50-1200 b/s) secure voice communication ; (2) voice/data integration in computer networks ; (3) speech recognition in fighter aircraft, military helicopters, battle management, and air traffic control training systems ; and (4) noise and interference removal for human listeners. Opportunities for advanced applications are identified by means of descriptions of several generic systems which would be possible with advances in speech technology and in system integration. These generic systems include : (1) integrated multi-rate voice/data communications terminal ; (2) interactive speech enhancement system ; (3) voice-controlled pilot's associate system ; (4) advanced air traffic control training systems ; (5) battle management command and control support system with spoken natural language interface ; and (6) spoken language translation system. In identifying problem areas and research efforts to meet application requirements, it is observed that some of the most promising research involves the integration of speech algorithm techniques including speech coding, speech recognition, and speaker recognition.
