T1	NoType 14 44	 increasingly need to produce 
T2	NoType 48 60	 written in 
T3	NoType 78 97	. However, typical 
T4	NoType 116 148	 require the user to change the 
T5	NoType 167 190	 each time a different 
T6	NoType 198 244	 is used. This is cumbersome, especially when 
T7	NoType 260 309	 are frequent. To solve this problem, we propose 
T8	NoType 316 326	, a novel 
T9	NoType 345 363	 that detects the 
T10	NoType 371 379	 of the 
T11	NoType 395 429	 and automatically dispatches the 
T12	NoType 434 454	 to the appropriate 
T13	NoType 471 509	. Unlike previously reported methods, 
T14	NoType 516 542	 can handle more than two 
T15	NoType 551 584	, and can easily support any new 
T16	NoType 592 615	 even if the available 
T17	NoType 621 673	 is small. When evaluating this method, we obtained 
T18	NoType 700 730	 of 96.7% when an appropriate 
T19	NoType 738 773	 had to be chosen from among three 
T20	NoType 782 798	. The number of 
T21	NoType 813 831	 needed to switch 
T22	NoType 840 875	 was decreased over 93% when using 
T23	NoType 882 897	 rather than a 
T24	NoType 916 918	.
