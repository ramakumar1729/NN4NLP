T1	NoType 16 66	 should be descriptively adequate and parsable. A 
T2	NoType 87 144	 is autonomous in the sense that it has certain explicit 
T3	NoType 161 197	. Such a description relates to the 
T4	NoType 220 228	 of the 
T5	NoType 237 250	, and to the 
T6	NoType 262 271	. As the 
T7	NoType 280 301	 is implemented in a 
T8	NoType 332 459	, we concentrate on issues that must be resolved by any practical system that uses such models. The correspondence between the 
T9	NoType 468 473	 and 
T10	NoType 485 500	 is discussed.
