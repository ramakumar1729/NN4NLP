T1	NoType 11 30	 for tasks such as 
T2	NoType 48 53	 and 
T3	NoType 75 94	 typically rely on 
T4	NoType 113 140	. But the efficacy of such 
T5	NoType 147 190	 can be surprisingly low, particularly for 
T6	NoType 199 211	 drawn from 
T7	NoType 232 245	 such as the 
T8	NoType 248 272	. We have observed that 
T9	NoType 288 324	 often result in wildly implausible 
T10	NoType 348 352	 of 
T11	NoType 361 405	, which can be detected automatically using 
T12	NoType 425 444	 obtained from the 
T13	NoType 447 489	. Based on this observation, we introduce 
T14	NoType 517 598	 ' a novel, domain-independent method for automatically detecting and discarding 
T15	NoType 614 652	. We measure the effectiveness of our 
T16	NoType 668 677	, called 
T17	NoType 685 694	, on two 
T18	NoType 710 724	. On a set of 
T19	NoType 738 790	, it reduces error by 67%. On a set of more complex 
T20	NoType 813 819	, the 
T21	NoType 842 852	 was 20%.
