T1	NoType 32 36	 of 
T2	NoType 59 118	 require a fine balance between structural flexibility and 
T3	NoType 142 170	. In previous work, several 
T4	NoType 181 224	 have been proposed to identify classes of 
T5	NoType 245 337	 that are well-balanced in this sense; the best-known but also most restrictive of these is 
T6	NoType 349 356	. Most 
T7	NoType 367 386	 are formulated on 
T8	NoType 412 467	, which makes them hard to integrate into models where 
T9	NoType 477 496	 are composed from 
T10	NoType 515 569	. In this paper, we show how two empirically relevant 
T11	NoType 580 584	 of 
T12	NoType 596 649	 can be lexicalized, and how combining the resulting 
T13	NoType 657 682	 with a regular means of 
T14	NoType 703 733	 gives rise to a hierarchy of 
T15	NoType 778 780	.
