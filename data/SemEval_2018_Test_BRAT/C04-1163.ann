T1	NoType 32 61	 are widely used to organize 
T2	NoType 70 97	 in a way that makes their 
T3	NoType 106 134	 easier. Common examples of 
T4	NoType 137 142	 are 
T5	NoType 157 185	, marketplace catalogs, and 
T6	NoType 197 237	. In this paper we discuss and evaluate 
T7	NoType 245 294	, an approach to interoperability that discovers 
T8	NoType 302 309	 among 
T9	NoType 312 329	 considering the 
T10	NoType 352 362	 of their 
T11	NoType 367 369	. 
T12	NoType 377 389	 performs a 
T13	NoType 410 418	 of the 
T14	NoType 424 441	 attached to the 
T15	NoType 446 458	, including 
T16	NoType 470 472	, 
T17	NoType 494 496	, 
T18	NoType 517 522	 and 
T19	NoType 547 622	. We present an evaluation of the overall performance of the approach over 
T20	NoType 637 678	 as well as a systematic analysis of the 
T21	NoType 696 707	 involved.
