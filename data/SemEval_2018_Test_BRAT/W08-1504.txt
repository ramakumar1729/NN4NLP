Voice over IP and the open source technologies are becoming popular choices for organizations. However, while accessing the VoiceXML gateways these systems fail to attract the global users economically. The objective of this paper is to demonstrate how an existing web application can be modified using VoiceXML to enable non-visual access from any phone. Moreover, we unleash a way for linking an existing PSTN-based phone line to a VoiceXML gateway even though the voice service provider (VSP) does not provide a local geographical number to global customers to access the application. In addition, we introduce an economical way for small sized businesses to overcome the high cost of setting up and using a commercial VoiceXML gateway. The method is based on Asterisk server. In order to elucidate the entire process, we present a sample Package Tracking System application, which is based on an existing website and provides the same functionality as the website does. We also present an online demonstration, which provides global access to commercial voice platforms (i.e. Voxeo, Tellme Studio, Bevocal and DemandVoice). This paper also discusses various scenarios in which spoken interaction can play a significant role.
