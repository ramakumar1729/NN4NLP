 
 This paper describes three relatively domain-independent capabilities recently added to the Paramax spoken language understanding system : non-monotonic reasoning , implicit reference resolution , and database query paraphrase . In addition, we discuss the results of the February 1992 ATIS benchmark tests . We describe a variation on the standard evaluation metric which provides a more tightly controlled measure of progress. Finally, we briefly describe an experiment which we have done in extending the n-best speech/language integration architecture to improving OCR accuracy .
