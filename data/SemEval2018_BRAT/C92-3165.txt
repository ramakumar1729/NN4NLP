When a very noisy portion is detected, the parser skips that portion using a fake non-terminal symbol . The unidentified portion is resolved by re-utterance of that portion which is parsed very efficiently by using the parse record of the first utterance . The user does not have to speak the whole sentence again. This method is also capable of handling unknown words , which is important in practical systems. Detected unknown words can be incrementally incorporated into the dictionary after the interaction with the user . A pilot system has shown great effectiveness of this approach.
