 
 In this paper we study a set of problems that are of considerable importance to Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) but which have not been addressed satisfactorily by the SMT research community . Over the last decade, a variety of SMT algorithms have been built and empirically tested whereas little is known about the computational complexity of some of the fundamental problems of SMT . Our work aims at providing useful insights into the the computational complexity of those problems. We prove that while IBM Models 1-2 are conceptually and computationally simple, computations involving the higher (and more useful) models are hard . Since it is unlikely that there exists a polynomial time solution for any of these hard problems (unless P = NP and P#P = P ), our results highlight and justify the need for developing polynomial time approximations for these computations. We also discuss some practical ways of dealing with complexity .
