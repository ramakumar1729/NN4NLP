Automatic summarization and information extraction are two important Internet services. MUC and SUMMAC play their appropriate roles in the next generation Internet. This paper focuses on the automatic summarization and proposes two different models to extract sentences for summary generation under two tasks initiated by SUMMAC-1. For categorization task, positive feature vectors and negative feature vectors are used cooperatively to construct generic, indicative summaries. For adhoc task, a text model based on relationship between nouns and verbs is used to filter out irrelevant discourse segment, to rank relevant sentences, and to generate the user-directed summaries. The result shows that the NormF of the best summary and that of the fixed summary for adhoc tasks are 0.456 and 0. 447. The NormF of the best summary and that of the fixed summary for categorization task are 0.4090 and 0.4023. Our system outperforms the average system in categorization task but does a common job in adhoc task.
