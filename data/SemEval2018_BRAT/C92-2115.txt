 
 The transfer phase in machine translation (MT) systems has been considered to be more complicated than analysis and generation , since it is inherently a conglomeration of individual lexical rules . Currently some attempts are being made to use case-based reasoning in machine translation , that is, to make decisions on the basis of translation examples at appropriate pints in MT . This paper proposes a new type of transfer system , called a Similarity-driven Transfer System (SimTran) , for use in such case-based MT (CBMT) .
