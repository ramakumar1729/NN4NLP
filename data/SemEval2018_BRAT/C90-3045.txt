 
 The unique properties of tree-adjoining grammars (TAG) present a challenge for the application of TAGs beyond the limited confines of syntax , for instance, to the task of semantic interpretation or automatic translation of natural language . We present a variant of TAGs , called synchronous TAGs , which characterize correspondences between languages . The formalism's intended usage is to relate expressions of natural languages to their associated semantics represented in a logical form language , or to their translates in another natural language ; in summary, we intend it to allow TAGs to be used beyond their role in syntax proper . We discuss the application of synchronous TAGs to concrete examples, mentioning primarily in passing some computational issues that arise in its interpretation.
