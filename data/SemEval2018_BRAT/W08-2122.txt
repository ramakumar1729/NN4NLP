We propose a solution to the challenge of the CoNLL 2008 shared task that uses a generative history-based latent variable model to predict the most likely derivation of a synchronous dependency parser for both syntactic and semantic dependencies. The submitted model yields 79.1% macro-average F1 performance, for the joint task, 86.9% syntactic dependencies LAS and 71.0% semantic dependencies F1. A larger model trained after the deadline achieves 80.5% macro-average F1, 87.6% syntactic dependencies LAS, and 73.1% semantic dependencies F1.
