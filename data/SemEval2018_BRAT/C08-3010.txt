In this paper, we will describe a search tool for a huge set of ngrams. The tool supports queries with an arbitrary number of wildcards. It takes a fraction of a second for a search, and can provide the fillers of the wildcards. The system runs on a single Linux PC with reasonable size memory (less than 4GB) and disk space (less than 400GB). This system can be a very useful tool for linguistic knowledge discovery and other NLP tasks.
