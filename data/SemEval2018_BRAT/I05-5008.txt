 We propose a method that automatically generates paraphrase sets from seed sentences to be used as reference sets in objective machine translation evaluation measures like BLEU and NIST . We measured the quality of the paraphrases produced in an experiment, i.e., (i) their grammaticality : at least 99% correct sentences ; (ii) their equivalence in meaning : at least 96% correct paraphrases either by meaning equivalence or entailment ; and, (iii) the amount of internal lexical and syntactical variation in a set of paraphrases : slightly superior to that of hand-produced sets . The paraphrase sets produced by this method thus seem adequate as reference sets to be used for MT evaluation .
