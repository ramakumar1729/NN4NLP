This paper shows that it is very often possible to identify the source language of medium-length speeches in the EUROPARL corpus on the basis of frequency counts of word n-grams (87.2%-96.7% accuracy depending on classification method). The paper also examines in detail which positive markers are most powerful and identifies a number of linguistic aspects as well as culture- and domain-related ones.
