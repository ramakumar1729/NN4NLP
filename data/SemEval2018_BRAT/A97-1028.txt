In this paper we present a statistical profile of the Named Entity task, a specific information extraction task for which corpora in several languages are available. Using the results of the statistical analysis, we propose an algorithm for lower bound estimation for Named Entity corpora and discuss the significance of the cross-lingual comparisons provided by the analysis.
