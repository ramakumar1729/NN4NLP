 We provide a logical definition of Minimalist grammars , that are Stabler's formalization of Chomsky's minimalist program . Our logical definition leads to a neat relation to categorial grammar , (yielding a treatment of Montague semantics ), a parsing-as-deduction in a resource sensitive logic , and a learning algorithm from structured data (based on a typing-algorithm and type-unification ). Here we emphasize the connection to Montague semantics which can be viewed as a formal computation of the logical form .
