 
 Automatic evaluation metrics for Machine Translation (MT) systems , such as BLEU or NIST , are now well established. Yet, they are scarcely used for the assessment of language pairs like English-Chinese or English-Japanese , because of the word segmentation problem . This study establishes the equivalence between the standard use of BLEU in word n-grams and its application at the character level. The use of BLEU at the character level eliminates the word segmentation problem : it makes it possible to directly compare commercial systems outputting unsegmented texts with, for instance, statistical MT systems which usually segment their outputs .
