This article is devoted to the problem of quantifying noun groups in German. After a thorough description of the phenomena, the results of corpus-based investigations are described. Moreover, some examples are given that underline the necessity of integrating some kind of information other than grammar sensu stricto into the treebank. We argue that a more sophisticated and fine-grained annotation in the tree-bank would have very positve effects on stochastic parsers trained on the tree-bank and on grammars induced from the treebank, and it would make the treebank more valuable as a source of data for theoretical linguistic investigations. The information gained from corpus research and the analyses that are proposed are realized in the framework of SILVA, a parsing and extraction tool for German text corpora.
