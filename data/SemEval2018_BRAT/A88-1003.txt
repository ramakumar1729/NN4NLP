 
 In this paper, we describe the pronominal anaphora resolution module of Lucy , a portable English understanding system . The design of this module was motivated by the observation that, although there exist many theories of anaphora resolution , no one of these theories is complete. Thus we have implemented a blackboard-like architecture in which individual partial theories can be encoded as separate modules that can interact to propose candidate antecedents and to evaluate each other's proposals.
