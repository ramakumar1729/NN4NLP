We present a text mining method for finding synonymous expressions based on the distributional hypothesis in a set of coherent corpora. This paper proposes a new methodology to improve the accuracy of a term aggregation system using each author's text as a coherent corpus. Our approach is based on the idea that one person tends to use one expression for one meaning. According to our assumption, most of the words with similar context features in each author's corpus tend not to be synonymous expressions. Our proposed method improves the accuracy of our term aggregation system, showing that our approach is successful.
