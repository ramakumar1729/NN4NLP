 At MIT Lincoln Laboratory, we have been developing a Korean-to-English machine translation system CCLINC (Common Coalition Language System at Lincoln Laboratory) . The CCLINC Korean-to-English translation system consists of two core modules , language understanding and generation modules mediated by a language neutral meaning representation called a semantic frame . The key features of the system include: (i) Robust efficient parsing of Korean (a verb final language with overt case markers , relatively free word order , and frequent omissions of arguments ). (ii) High quality translation via word sense disambiguation and accurate word order generation of the target language . (iii) Rapid system development and porting to new domains via knowledge-based automated acquisition of grammars . Having been trained on Korean newspaper articles on missiles and chemical biological warfare, the system produces the translation output sufficient for content understanding of the original document .
