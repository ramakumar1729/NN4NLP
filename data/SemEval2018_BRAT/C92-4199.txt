 
 Word Identification has been an important and active issue in Chinese Natural Language Processing . In this paper, a new mechanism, based on the concept of sublanguage , is proposed for identifying unknown words , especially personal names , in Chinese newspapers . The proposed mechanism includes title-driven name recognition , adaptive dynamic word formation , identification of 2-character and 3-character Chinese names without title . We will show the experimental results for two corpora and compare them with the results by the NTHU's statistic-based system , the only system that we know has attacked the same problem. The experimental results have shown significant improvements over the WI systems without the name identification capability.
