In this paper, we show how to construct a transfer dictionary automatically. Dictionary construction, one of the most difficult tasks in developing a machine translation system, is expensive. To avoid this problem, we investigate how we build a dictionary using existing linguistic resources. Our algorithm can be applied to any language pairs, but for the present we focus on building a Korean-to-Japanese dictionary using English as a pivot. We attempt three ways of automatic construction to corroborate the effect of the directionality of dictionaries. First, we introduce "one-time look up" method using a Korean-to-English and a Japanese-to-English dictionary. Second, we show a method using "overlapping constraint" with a Korean-to-English dictionary and an English-to-Japanese dictionary. Third, we consider another alternative method rarely used for building a dictionary: an English-to-Korean dictionary and English-to-Japanese dictionary. We found that the first method is the most effective and the best result can be obtained from combining the three methods.
