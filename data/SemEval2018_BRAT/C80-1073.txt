 
 An attempt has been made to use an Augmented Transition Network as a procedural dialog model . The development of such a model appears to be important in several respects: as a device to represent and to use different dialog schemata proposed in empirical conversation analysis ; as a device to represent and to use models of verbal interaction ; as a device combining knowledge about dialog schemata and about verbal interaction with knowledge about task-oriented and goal-directed dialogs . A standard ATN should be further developed in order to account for the verbal interactions of task-oriented dialogs .
