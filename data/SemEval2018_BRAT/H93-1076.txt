Two themes have evolved in speech and text image processing work at Xerox PARC that expand and redefine the role of recognition technology in document-oriented applications. One is the development of systems that provide functionality similar to that of text processors but operate directly on audio and scanned image data. A second, related theme is the use of speech and text-image recognition to retrieve arbitrary, user-specified information from documents with signal content. This paper discusses three research initiatives at PARC that exemplify these themes: a text-image editor[1], a wordspotter for voice editing and indexing[12], and a decoding framework for scanned-document content retrieval[4]. The discussion focuses on key concepts embodied in the research that enable novel signal-based document processing functionality.
