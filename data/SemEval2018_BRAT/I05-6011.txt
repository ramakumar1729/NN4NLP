 This paper proposes an annotating scheme that encodes honorifics (respectful words). Honorifics are used extensively in Japanese , reflecting the social relationship (e.g. social ranks and age) of the referents . This referential information is vital for resolving zero pronouns and improving machine translation outputs . Annotating honorifics is a complex task that involves identifying a predicate with honorifics , assigning ranks to referents of the predicate , calibrating the ranks , and connecting referents with their predicates .
