This article deals with the interpretation of conceptual operations underlying the communicative use of natural language (NL) within the Structured Inheritance Network (SI-Nets) paradigm. The operations are reduced to functions of a formal language, thus changing the level of abstraction of the operations to be performed on SI-Nets. In this sense, operations on SI-Nets are not merely isomorphic to single epistemological objects, but can be viewed as a simulation of processes on a different level, that pertaining to the conceptual system of NL. For this purpose, we have designed a version of KL-ONE which represents the epistemological level, while the new experimental language, KL-Conc, represents the conceptual level. KL-Conc would seem to be a more natural and intuitive way of interacting with SI-Nets.
