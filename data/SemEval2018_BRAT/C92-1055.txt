 
 In this paper, a discrimination and robustness oriented adaptive learning procedure is proposed to deal with the task of syntactic ambiguity resolution . Owing to the problem of insufficient training data and approximation error introduced by the language model , traditional statistical approaches , which resolve ambiguities by indirectly and implicitly using maximum likelihood method , fail to achieve high performance in real applications. The proposed method remedies these problems by adjusting the parameters to maximize the accuracy rate directly. To make the proposed algorithm robust, the possible variations between the training corpus and the real tasks are also taken into consideration by enlarging the separation margin between the correct candidate and its competing members. Significant improvement has been observed in the test. The accuracy rate of syntactic disambiguation is raised from 46.0% to 60.62% by using this novel approach.
