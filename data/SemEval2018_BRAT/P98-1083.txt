This paper describes novel and practical Japanese parsers that uses decision trees. First, we construct a single decision tree to estimate modification probabilities; how one phrase tends to modify another. Next, we introduce a boosting algorithm in which several decision trees are constructed and then combined for probability estimation. The two constructed parsers are evaluated by using the EDR Japanese annotated corpus. The single-tree method outperforms the conventional Japanese stochastic methods by 4%. Moreover, the boosting version is shown to have significant advantages; 1) better parsing accuracy than its single-tree counterpart for any amount of training data and 2) no over-fitting to data for various iterations.
