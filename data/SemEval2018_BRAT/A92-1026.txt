 
 It is often assumed that when natural language processing meets the real world, the ideal of aiming for complete and correct interpretations has to be abandoned. However, our experience with TACITUS ; especially in the MUC-3 evaluation , has shown that principled techniques for syntactic and pragmatic analysis can be bolstered with methods for achieving robustness. We describe three techniques for making syntactic analysis more robust---an agenda-based scheduling parser , a recovery technique for failed parses , and a new technique called terminal substring parsing . For pragmatics processing , we describe how the method of abductive inference is inherently robust, in that an interpretation is always possible, so that in the absence of the required world knowledge , performance degrades gracefully. Each of these techniques have been evaluated and the results of the evaluations are presented.
