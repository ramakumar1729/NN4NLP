This paper reports recent research into methods for creating natural language text. A new processing paradigm called Fragment-and-Compose has been created and an experimental system implemented in it. The knowledge to be expressed in text is first divided into small propositional units, which are then composed into appropriate combinations and converted into text.KDS (Knowledge Delivery System), which embodies this paradigm, has distinct parts devoted to creation of the propositional units, to organization of the text, to prevention of excess redundancy, to creation of combinations of units, to evaluation of these combinations as potential sentences, to selection of the best among competing combinations, and to creation of the final text. The Fragment-and-Compose paradigm and the computational methods of KDS are described.
