This paper describes a particular approach to parsing that utilizes recent advances in unification-based parsing and in classification-based knowledge representation. As unification-based grammatical frameworks are extended to handle richer descriptions of linguistic information, they begin to share many of the properties that have been developed in KL-ONE-like knowledge representation systems. This commonality suggests that some of the classification-based representation techniques can be applied to unification-based linguistic descriptions. This merging supports the integration of semantic and syntactic information into the same system, simultaneously subject to the same types of processes, in an efficient manner. The result is expected to be more efficient parsing due to the increased organization of knowledge. The use of a KL-ONE style representation for parsing and semantic interpretation was first explored in the PSI-KLONE system [2], in which parsing is characterized as an inference process called incremental description refinement.
