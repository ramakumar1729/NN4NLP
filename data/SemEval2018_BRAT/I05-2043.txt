Using natural language processing, we carried out a trend survey on Japanese natural language processing studies that have been done over the last ten years. We determined the changes in the number of papers published for each research organization and on each research area as well as the relationship between research organizations and research areas. This paper is useful for both recognizing trends in Japanese NLP and constructing a method of supporting trend surveys using NLP.
