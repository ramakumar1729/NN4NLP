 
 Although every natural language system needs a computational lexicon , each system puts different amounts and types of information into its lexicon according to its individual needs. However, some of the information needed across systems is shared or identical information. This paper presents our experience in planning and building COMPLEX , a computational lexicon designed to be a repository of shared lexical information for use by Natural Language Processing (NLP) systems . We have drawn primarily on explicit and implicit information from machine-readable dictionaries (MRD's) to create a broad coverage lexicon .
