This paper shows how dictionary word sense definitions can be analysed by applying a hierarchy of phrasal patterns. An experimental system embodying this mechanism has been implemented for processing definitions from the Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English. A property of this dictionary, exploited by the system, is that it uses a restricted vocabulary in its word sense definitions. The structures generated by the experimental system are intended to be used for the classification of new word senses in terms of the senses of words in the restricted vocabulary. Examples illustrating the output generated are presented, and some qualitative performance results and problems that were encountered are discussed. The analysis process applies successively more specific phrasal analysis rules as determined by a hierarchy of patterns in which less specific patterns dominate more specific ones. This ensures that reasonable incomplete analyses of the definitions are produced when more complete analyses are not possible, resulting in a relatively robust analysis mechanism. Thus the work reported addresses two robustness problems faced by current experimental natural language processing systems: coping with an incomplete lexicon and with incomplete knowledge of phrasal constructions.
