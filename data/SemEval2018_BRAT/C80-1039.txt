 
 In order to meet the needs of a publication of papers in English, many systems to run off texts have been developed. In this paper, we report a system FROFF which can make a fair copy of not only texts but also graphs and tables indispensable to our papers. Its selection of fonts , specification of character size are dynamically changeable, and the typing location can be also changed in lateral or longitudinal directions. Each character has its own width and a line length is counted by the sum of each character . By using commands or rules which are defined to facilitate the construction of format expected or some mathematical expressions , elaborate and pretty documents can be successfully obtained.
