 
 Recent advances in Automatic Speech Recognition technology have put the goal of naturally sounding dialog systems within reach. However, the improved speech recognition has brought to light a new problem: as dialog systems understand more of what the user tells them, they need to be more sophisticated at responding to the user . The issue of system response to users has been extensively studied by the natural language generation community , though rarely in the context of dialog systems . We show how research in generation can be adapted to dialog systems , and how the high cost of hand-crafting knowledge-based generation systems can be overcome by employing machine learning techniques .
