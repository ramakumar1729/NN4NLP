We provide a unified account of sentence-level and text-level anaphora within the framework of a dependency-based grammar model. Criteria for anaphora resolution within sentence boundaries rephrase major concepts from GB's binding theory, while those for text-level anaphora incorporate an adapted version of a Grosz-Sidner-style focus model.
