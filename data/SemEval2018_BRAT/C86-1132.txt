 
 This paper describes a system ( RAREAS ) which synthesizes marine weather forecasts directly from formatted weather data . Such synthesis appears feasible in certain natural sublanguages with stereotyped text structure . RAREAS draws on several kinds of linguistic and non-linguistic knowledge and mirrors a forecaster's apparent tendency to ascribe less precise temporal adverbs to more remote meteorological events. The approach can easily be adapted to synthesize bilingual or multi-lingual texts .
