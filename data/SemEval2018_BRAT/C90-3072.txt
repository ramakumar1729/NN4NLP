 
 Spelling-checkers have become an integral part of most text processing software . From different reasons among which the speed of processing prevails they are usually based on dictionaries of word forms instead of words . This approach is sufficient for languages with little inflection such as English , but fails for highly inflective languages such as Czech , Russian , Slovak or other Slavonic languages . We have developed a special method for describing inflection for the purpose of building spelling-checkers for such languages. The speed of the resulting program lies somewhere in the middle of the scale of existing spelling-checkers for English and the main dictionary fits into the standard 360K floppy , whereas the number of recognized word forms exceeds 6 million (for Czech ). Further, a special method has been developed for easy word classification .
