 
 Chart parsing is directional in the sense that it works from the starting point (usually the beginning of the sentence) extending its activity usually in a rightward manner. We shall introduce the concept of a chart that works outward from islands and makes sense of as much of the sentence as it is actually possible, and after that will lead to predictions of missing fragments . So, for any place where the easily identifiable fragments occur in the sentence , the process will extend to both the left and the right of the islands , until possibly completely missing fragments are reached. At that point, by virtue of the fact that both a left and a right context were found, heuristics can be introduced that predict the nature of the missing fragments .
