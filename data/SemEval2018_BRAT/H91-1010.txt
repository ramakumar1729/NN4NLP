The following describes recent work on the Lincoln CSR system. Some new variations in semiphone modeling have been tested. A very simple improved duration model has reduced the error rate by about 10% in both triphone and semiphone systems. A new training strategy has been tested which, by itself, did not provide useful improvements but suggests that improvements can be obtained by a related rapid adaptation technique. Finally, the recognizer has been modified to use bigram back-off language models. The system was then transferred from the RM task to the ATIS CSR task and a limited number of development tests performed. Evaluation test results are presented for both the RM and ATIS CSR tasks.
