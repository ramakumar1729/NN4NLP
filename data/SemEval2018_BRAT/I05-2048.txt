 Statistical machine translation (SMT) is currently one of the hot spots in natural language processing . Over the last few years dramatic improvements have been made, and a number of comparative evaluations have shown, that SMT gives competitive results to rule-based translation systems , requiring significantly less development time. This is particularly important when building translation systems for new language pairs or new domains . This workshop is intended to give an introduction to statistical machine translation with a focus on practical considerations. Participants should be able, after attending this workshop, to set out building an SMT system themselves and achieving good baseline results in a short time. The tutorial will cover the basics of SMT : Theory will be put into practice. STTK , a statistical machine translation tool kit , will be introduced and used to build a working translation system . STTK has been developed by the presenter and co-workers over a number of years and is currently used as the basis of CMU's SMT system . It has also successfully been coupled with rule-based and example based machine translation modules to build a multi engine machine translation system . The source code of the tool kit will be made available.
