 
 Soames 1979 provides some counterexamples to the theory of natural language presuppositions that is presented in Gazdar 1979. Soames 1982 provides a theory which explains these counterexamples. Mercer 1987 rejects the solution found in Soames 1982 leaving these counterexamples unexplained. By reappraising these insightful counterexamples, the inferential theory for natural language presuppositions described in Mercer 1987, 1988 gives a simple and straightforward explanation for the presuppositional nature of these sentences .
