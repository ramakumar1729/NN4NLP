 The reality of analogies between words is refuted by noone (e.g., I walked is to to walk as I laughed is to to laugh, noted I walked : to walk :: I laughed : to laugh). But computational linguists seem to be quite dubious about analogies between sentences : they would not be enough numerous to be of any use. We report experiments conducted on a multilingual corpus to estimate the number of analogies among the sentences that it contains. We give two estimates, a lower one and a higher one. As an analogy must be valid on the level of form as well as on the level of meaning , we relied on the idea that translation should preserve meaning to test for similar meanings .
