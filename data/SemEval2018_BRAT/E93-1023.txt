One of the major problems one is faced with when decomposing words into their constituent parts is ambiguity: the generation of multiple analyses for one input word, many of which are implausible. In order to deal with ambiguity, the MORphological PArser MORPA is provided with a probabilistic context-free grammar (PCFG), i.e. it combines a "conventional" context-free morphological grammar to filter out ungrammatical segmentations with a probability-based scoring function which determines the likelihood of each successful parse. Consequently, remaining analyses can be ordered along a scale of plausibility. Test performance data will show that a PCFG yields good results in morphological parsing. MORPA is a fully implemented parser developed for use in a text-to-speech conversion system.
