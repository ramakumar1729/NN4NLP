The TIPSTER Architecture has been designed to enable a variety of different text applications to use a set of common text processing modules. Since user interfaces work best when customized for particular applications , it is appropriator that no particular user interface styles or conventions are described in the TIPSTER Architecture specification. However, the Computing Research Laboratory (CRL) has constructed several TIPSTER applications that use a common set of configurable Graphical User Interface (GUI) functions. These GUIs were constructed using CRL's TIPSTER User Interface Toolkit (TUIT). TUIT is a software library that can be used to construct multilingual TIPSTER user interfaces for a set of common user tasks. CRL developed TUIT to support their work to integrate TIPSTER modules for the 6 and 12 month TIPSTER II demonstrations as well as their Oleada and Temple demonstration projects. This paper briefly describes TUIT and its capabilities.
