This paper describes a novel system for acquiring adjectival subcategorization frames (scfs) and associated frequency information from English corpus data. The system incorporates a decision-tree classifier for 30 scf types which tests for the presence of grammatical relations (grs) in the output of a robust statistical parser. It uses a powerful pattern-matching language to classify grs into frames hierarchically in a way that mirrors inheritance-based lexica. The experiments show that the system is able to detect scf types with 70% precision and 66% recall rate. A new tool for linguistic annotation of scfs in corpus data is also introduced which can considerably alleviate the process of obtaining training and test data for subcategorization acquisition.
