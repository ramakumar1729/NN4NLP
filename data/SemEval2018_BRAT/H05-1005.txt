 In this paper, we use the information redundancy in multilingual input to correct errors in machine translation and thus improve the quality of multilingual summaries . We consider the case of multi-document summarization , where the input documents are in Arabic , and the output summary is in English . Typically, information that makes it to a summary appears in many different lexical-syntactic forms in the input documents . Further, the use of multiple machine translation systems provides yet more redundancy , yielding different ways to realize that information in English . We demonstrate how errors in the machine translations of the input Arabic documents can be corrected by identifying and generating from such redundancy , focusing on noun phrases .
