Porting a Natural Language Processing (NLP) system to a new domain remains one of the bottlenecks in syntactic parsing, because of the amount of effort required to fix gaps in the lexicon, and to attune the existing grammar to the idiosyncracies of the new sublanguage. This paper shows how the process of fitting a lexicalized grammar to a domain can be automated to a great extent by using a hybrid system that combines traditional knowledge-based techniques with a corpus-based approach.
